# Kossel Delta 3D Printer Project
This repository is meant for Andy Zhou's delta printer project and contains all files regarding the project.
A 3D printer that is best for the price to performance ratio. 
The estimated cost was about $200. 
This printerâ€™s hotend is controlled by three motors that all move vertically, but by moving each motor independently, the hotend is able to move in whichever direction needed.
